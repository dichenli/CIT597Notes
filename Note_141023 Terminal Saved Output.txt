You can implement step definitions for undefined steps with these snippets:

Given(/^I'm on the album creationpage$/) do
  pending # express the regexp above with the code you wish you had
end

When(/^I add a new album$/) do
  pending # express the regexp above with the code you wish you had
end

Then(/^I should see the newly created album$/) do
  pending # express the regexp above with the code you wish you had
end
