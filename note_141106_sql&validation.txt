controller codes:
localhost:3000/songs.json show json form

SQL
-Join:
Album has id and name,
Song has id, title and album_id
JOIN TableX AND TableY ON <boolean expression>

#this will join two tables and associate album with its songs
JOIN Album AND Song ON Album.id == Song.album_id
it will yield table:
album.id || name || song.id || title || album_id

(if we use: JOIN Album AND Song ON True
if will do cartesian product of all possible (album, song) pairs and create each row for each pair)

rails g scaffold review rating:integer song:references (references: belongs_to relation)
rails c:
Album.find(33).reviews (will show all reviews associated with song 33)
Album.find(33).reviews.average(:rating) (calculate average of ratings)
