rails g migration --help

rails g migration AddDescriptionToReview description:text
#convention over configuration: AddDescriptionToReview does the change method automatically

rake db:migrate

#now we have added description to review model, but it has no views, we can add them by ourselves, or:

#a destructive way
rm -rf app/views/reviews/*
#remove all files in views/reviews

rails g scaffold Review rating:integer song:references description:text -s
#-s means don't overwrite existing files
#it will create new views for review model

rake db:rollback #to revert last migrate
rake db:migrate #to do migration again

#good reference for migration:

annotate --routes


in routes file, change:
resources :albums, :except => [:destroy, :show]

now show and destroy are not available to albums

#routes globbing

root :to => 'albums#index'

  resources :albums do
    resources :songs
  end

#now the routes would be: albums/album_id/songs/song_id

#the level of nesting shouldn't be too much, it will make url too complicated

in routes, we still need to keep resources :songs, otherwise song_path, new_song_path won't be defined.


in song controller:

  def index
    if(params[:album_id]) then
      @songs = Song.where('album_id = ?', params[:album_id])
    else
      @songs = Song.all
    end
  end
