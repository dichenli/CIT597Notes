add a 'like' button to listing quote. No need for view, we just add a like button in quote view. 
We need a 'like' model. 
rails g model like user:references quote:references

In the view of quotes, add: 
<td><%= link_to 'Like', like_quote_path(quote: :quote.id) method: :post %><\td>

go to config/routes
post 'like/quote' => "users#like"

go to user model:
has_many likes

go to like model:
belong_to user

go to controller of user
def like
	#set_user is needed but  set in before_action
	newLike = @user.likes.new #create will try to put the object to database, new will just make new object
	quote = Quote.find(params[:quote])
	newLike.quote = quote
	newLike.save
	redirect_to quote_path
end

Likes.all
User.find(1)
User.find([2, 4, 8])
User.find_by first_name: "Josh"
str = "there is beer"
Quoyes.find_by quote: str
