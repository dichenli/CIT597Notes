View: Layout
Asset Tags
stylesheet_link_tag
javascript_include_tag
application.js is a manifest file that include all needed JS files (so it's a header file)

include_tree is used for hieriarcy include of all related .js files. In production mode, all them are compressed to one .js file.

image_tag: it could have multiple image types, you need to specify what file types to include

yield & content_for: to yield different parts of a view file into separate places of the layout (example on Rails guide, yield :head, content_for :head). Good practice is not to include too many different parts of yield. It will be too complecated to keep track

Partial: to include multiple view files into one. Always start with a "_". It's not designed for showing independently

heroku addons, add gem in production mode
